This repository demonstrates an uncommon yet crucial issue in Elixir when dealing with exception handling in Enum.each and similar functions.  The code snippet shows how the `throw` macro prematurely halts the enumeration, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.  The solution provides an alternative using `Enum.reduce` or a try-catch block for more controlled exception handling within the enumeration.
